Ingredients

2 tablespoons butter
1 1/2 cups long-grain white rice
1 onion, chopped
1 green pepper, chopped
One 28-ounce can diced tomatoes
One 4-ounce jar diced pimiento
Pinch salt
Pinch cayenne
Several dashes hot sauce


Directions
Watch how to make this recipe.
Melt the butter in a medium, heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium-low heat.
Add the rice, onion and green pepper, and saute until the rice is slightly
browned and the vegetables are softened, 8 to 10 minutes. Stir in the tomatoes,
pimiento, salt, cayenne and hot sauce. Bring to a boil, cover and reduce the
heat to low. Simmer for 20 minutes, then fluff with a fork. If the rice is
tender but too soupy, cook uncovered for another 5 minutes. If the rice is dry
but not yet tender, add 1/2 cup water, cover and continue cooking for another 5
minutes, or until the rice is done.
